      <p>Well the party was nice, the party was pumping (Hey, Yippie-Yi-Yo)</p>
      <p>And everybody having a ball (Hah, ho, Yippie-Yi-Yo)</p>
      <p>Until the fellas started name-calling (Yippie-Yi-Yo)</p>
      <p>And the girls respond to the call, I heard a woman shout out</p>
    </div>
    <div class="refrein">
      <p>Who let the dogs out? Who, who, who?</p>
      <p>Who let the dogs out? Who, who, who?</p>

      <p>Last year in the dance you had a ball</p>
      <p>Called me mealybug and sketel</p>
      <p>Get back gruffy, back scruffy</p>
      <p>Get back you flea-infested mongrel!</p>
    </div>
    <div class="lines">
      <p>Gonna tell myself "Hey man no get angry" (Hey Yippie-Yi-Yo)</p>
      <p>To any girls calling them canine (Yippie-Yi-Yo)</p>
      <p>But they tell me "Hey Man It's part of the Party!" (Yippie-Yi-Yo)</p>
      <p>
        You put a woman in front and her man behind (Yippie-Yi-Yo), I heard a
        woman shout out
      </p>

    <h2>Summary:</h2>
    <p class="summary">
      John Rambo is a disoriented Vietnam Vet. He is hitchhiking from town to
      town to see friends from the war. A sheriff tries to make him leave town
      and when he refuses, arrests him for vagrancy. While in jail, a deputy
      takes delight in abusing him. Rambo escapes showing his old Vietnam
      fighting skills and takes to the woods as the sheriff and deputies try and
      find him in his element. Things get out of hand as Colonel Trautman,
      Rambo's old commander, appears to shed light on the situation.
